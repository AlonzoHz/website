                Alonzo Hernandez is a first year computer science student at Georgia Tech. His passion for programming started with in middle school with Scratch. Since then he has extensively used Java, Python, and PHP for personal and professional projects.  Currently, he is interested in algorithm design, physical system simulation, and web development. <br/> <br/>
                
                In high school, Alonzo researched at Georgia Tech's Brown Lab for Cold Molecular Ions and Quantum Information where he worked with a team of researchers to create a quantum circuit simulator that determines the efficacy of certain error correction algorithms. The result was a Monte Carlo based Python program that operates on quantum systems to determine the likelihood that the system has a critical failure. <br/> <br/>

                During the summer of 2016, Alonzo organized weekly Super Smash Bro's tournaments at his house and collected data which he used to analyze player performance. This analysis was then made public so that competitors could evaluate their skills and improve. The statistics were a driving force in the improvement of the many players. <br/> <br/>

                Over the next five years, Alonzo hopes to get experience applying his programming skills in an industry context. He will also continue exploring new realms of computer science through research and personal projects.
