# website
The development page for my personal website at http://alonzoh.me/. Although I have never worked on a website project that is as front-end focused as this one (i.e. looks matter), I've outlined some goals for myself that I hope to meet.
+ Make use of responsive code beyond that which HTML5 provides and without the crutch of a responsive library (Bootstrap). 
+ Use Javascript and jQuery to provide compelling interaction.
+ Provide clear navigation. 
+ Effectively present my programming work.
